## Detailed Content Analysis

### Rigorous Mode Response Breakdown

The o3 model provided a comprehensive "menu" of self-healing concrete additives:

#### 1. Bacteria-Based Mineral Precipitation
```
• Mechanism: Bacillus sphaericus/pseudofirmus metabolise nutrients → CaCO₃ precipitation
• Dosage: 10⁵–10⁸ spores/cm³ in 0.2–0.5mm capsules, 1–3 wt% of cement
• Performance: Heals cracks up to 0.8mm, repeatable if nutrients remain
• Limitations: High cost, strength loss potential, temperature/pH constraints
```

#### 2. Crystalline Waterproofing Admixtures
```
• Mechanism: Hydrophilic silicates + cement hydrates → C-S-H needle growth
• Dosage: 1–2 wt% powder or 3–6 L/m³ liquid
• Performance: Seals micro-cracks <0.4mm, commercially proven (Xypex, Penetron)
• Limitations: Moisture-dependent, proprietary formulations
```

#### 3. Superabsorbent Polymers (SAPs)
```
• Mechanism: Poly(acrylate-co-acrylamide) swelling + internal curing
• Dosage: 0.2–0.6 wt%, 50–500 µm particles
• Performance: Repeatable healing, improves early-age strength
• Limitations: Strength reduction, <0.5mm crack limitation
```

#### 4. Micro-Encapsulated Reactive Liquids
```
• Mechanism: Crack ruptures capsules → epoxy/cyanoacrylate/silicate release
• Dosage: 1–5 wt%, 50–300 µm urea-formaldehyde/polyurethane capsules
• Performance: Rapid on-demand healing, tailorable chemistry
• Limitations: Single-use, potential strength reduction, durability questions
```

#### 5. Hollow Glass Fibres/Vascular Networks
```
• Mechanism: Crack breaks fibres → capillary wicking of two-part healing resin
• Dosage: 0.5–2 vol% fibres or pre-fabricated micro-tubing
• Performance: Heals millimetre-scale cracks, adds reinforcement
• Limitations: Manufacturing complexity, clogging risk, limited adoption
```

#### 6. Calcium-Sulfoaluminate (CSA) Expansive Additives
```
• Mechanism: Ettringite formation → expansion + crack closure + belite hydration
• Dosage: 10–20 wt% OPC replacement
• Performance: Lower CO₂ footprint, good early strength
• Limitations: Expansion control required, fine crack focus only
```

#### 7. Shape-Memory Alloys (SMAs)
```
• Mechanism: Pre-strained NiTi fibres recover shape → active crack closure
• Dosage: 0.5–2 vol% short fibres
• Performance: Active closure <0.2mm, mechanical benefits
• Limitations: Very expensive, thermal activation required, niche applications
```

#### Selection Guidelines Provided:
- **Crack Size Mapping**: <0.3mm → crystalline/SAPs, 0.3-0.8mm → bacteria/capsules, ≥1mm → fibres/SMA
- **Environmental Considerations**: Marine → inorganic, freeze-thaw → SAPs, high temp → avoid bacteria/organics
- **Economic Analysis**: Mass infrastructure → crystalline/CSA (<5% premium), specialized → bacteria/capsules/SMA (20-100% premium)
