## Crystalyse Response

Stability assessment for key thermoelectric classes (MACE_mp_medium):

Composition  ΔEf/atom (eV)  
– CoSb₃       avg –0.7445 (–0.741, –0.809, –0.683)  
– FeVSb       avg –0.8607 (–0.8608, –0.8607, –0.8607)  
– FeNbSb      avg –0.1097 (–0.1033, –0.1145, –0.1114)  

All three are thermodynamically stable (ΔEf < 0).  
• Best candidates:  
  • FeVSb (half‐Heusler, ΔEf≈–0.861 eV/atom)  
  • CoSb₃ (skutterudite, ΔEf≈–0.745 eV/atom)  

• FeNbSb also stable but less negative ΔEf (–0.11 eV/atom).  

Sustainability:  
• Co/Sb, Fe/V/Sb: moderately abundant, no critical elements.  
• Sb use is a caution (criticality moderate); V and Co supply risk moderate.  

Recommendation: FeVSb exhibits the most negative formation energy and is a prime stable half‐Heusler thermoelectric. CoSb₃ is also robust as a skutterudite.

Next steps:  
1. DFT electronic‐structure for bandgap and carrier effective masses.  
2. Boltzmann transport modeling (Seebeck, σ) at target temperatures.  
3. Phonon dispersion for lattice thermal conductivity.

Let me know which follow‐up analysis to pursue.
