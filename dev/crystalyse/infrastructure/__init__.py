"""
Infrastructure components for Crystalyse.

Note: MCP-based infrastructure (connection pooling, session management) has been
deprecated in favor of the V2 skills-based architecture. This module is kept as
a placeholder for future infrastructure components.

For memory/session management, use the crystalyse.memory module instead.
