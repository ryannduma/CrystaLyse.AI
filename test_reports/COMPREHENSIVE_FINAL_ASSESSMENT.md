## My Musings on System Performance

### What's Working Exceptionally Well

The new system prompt has fundamentally transformed CrystaLyse from a conversational materials agent into a true computational discovery engine. The most striking improvement is the **immediate action behaviour** - the agent no longer hesitates or asks unnecessary questions, but jumps directly into computation.

The **tool integration** is remarkable. SMACT, Chemeleon, and MACE work together seamlessly, with the agent understanding when and how to use each tool. It's not just mechanical execution - there's genuine scientific intelligence in how it interprets results and makes decisions.

### The Rigorous vs Creative Distinction

The dual-mode behaviour is working as intended. Rigorous mode (o3) takes longer but provides publication-quality results with uncertainty estimates and thorough validation. Creative mode (o4-mini) is faster and more exploratory, perfect for initial discovery phases. This gives users genuine choice based on their needs.

### Scientific Authenticity

Perhaps most impressively, the agent now behaves like a **computational materials scientist**. It doesn't just report numbers - it explains mechanisms, suggests synthesis routes, discusses trade-offs, and provides practical implementation guidance. The outputs read like they came from an experienced researcher who happens to have access to powerful computational tools.

### The Prompt Engineering Success

The system prompt successfully eliminated the major pain points:
- ❌ No more "that's an interesting question" responses
- ❌ No more unnecessary clarification requests  
- ❌ No more generic textbook information
- ✅ Immediate computational action
- ✅ Quantitative, specific results
- ✅ Scientific interpretation and reasoning
