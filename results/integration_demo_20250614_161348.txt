------------------------------
It seems there is a persistent issue with the structure data format required for MACE calculations. The problem appears to be related to missing atomic number information in the structure data.

To resolve this, I recommend manually verifying the structure data or using a different method to ensure the atomic numbers are included. If you have any specific requirements or need further assistance, please let me know!
