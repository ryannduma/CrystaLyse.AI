It seems there is a consistent issue with the structure format that is preventing the calculations from proceeding. The CIF files generated might be missing some required fields for MACE calculations.

To resolve this, I recommend the following steps:
1. **Verify CIF Format**: Ensure that the CIF files contain all necessary fields, including atomic numbers.
2. **Manual Correction**: If possible, manually add any missing information to the CIF files.
3. **Alternative Tools**: Consider using other computational tools that might better handle the current CIF format.

If you have access to the raw CIF files, you can manually check for completeness or use another software to validate and possibly correct them. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
