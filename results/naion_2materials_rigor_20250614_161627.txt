It appears there is a persistent issue with the structure format that needs to be addressed. Let's ensure that all necessary fields are included in the structure format for successful energy calculations.

### Correct Structure Format

1. **Verify Required Fields**: Ensure the structure includes all necessary fields such as atomic numbers and positions.
2. **Reattempt Calculations**: Once the format is corrected, proceed with energy calculations.

I'll correct the format and reattempt the calculations. If you have any specific requirements or questions, please let me know!
