Here's the energy and stability analysis for the BaTiO3 structure:

### Energy Analysis
- **Total Energy:** -39.97 eV
- **Energy per Atom:** -7.99 eV/atom
- **Energy Uncertainty:** 0.0 eV (High confidence)

### Formation Energy
- **Formation Energy:** -27.33 eV
- **Formation Energy per Atom:** -5.47 eV/atom
- **Stability Assessment:** Very stable

### Forces
- **Forces Uncertainty:** \(4.83 \times 10^{-8}\) eV/Å

### Relaxation
- An error occurred during the relaxation process: "Object of type bool_ is not JSON serializable." This might be related to the handling of periodic boundary conditions. Further investigation is needed for relaxation.

Overall, the BaTiO3 structure appears to be very stable with high confidence in the energy calculations. If you need further analysis or adjustments, please let me know!
