It seems there is a persistent issue with the structure data format required for the formation energy calculation. The error indicates a missing field, likely related to atomic numbers or similar identifiers.

### Action Plan:
1. **Review Structure Data**: Ensure all necessary fields, such as atomic numbers, are included.
2. **Retry Calculations**: With corrected and complete structure data.

I'll address this issue and proceed with the calculations. If you have any specific requirements or additional information, please let me know!
