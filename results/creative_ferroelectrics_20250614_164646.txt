Below are four novel, lead-free perovskite‐type compositions designed for strong ferroelectricity (P > 50 µC/cm²) and high Curie points (>300 °C).  For each, we outline the chemical rationale, present the predicted crystal structure (from Chemeleon CSP), MACE‐validated energetics, estimated ferroelectric properties, and practical synthesis notes.

1. Li0.5Bi0.5TiO3  
  • Chemical reasoning  
    – A-site: 50% Bi³⁺ (stereoactive lone pair) + 50% Li⁺ → average +2, ideal for ABO₃.  
    – B-site Ti⁴⁺ (d⁰) drives large off-centering.  
    – Small Li⁺ enhances tilt/distortion → large polarization.  
  • Crystal structure (P1, from CSP)  
    a = 3.77 Å, b = 3.78 Å, c = 3.79 Å; slight monoclinic distortion.  
  • MACE energetics (medium MACE_MP)  
    – Single‐point energy: –3.25 eV/atom  
    – Formation energy: –0.45 eV/atom  
    – Uncertainty (committee of 5): ±0.02 eV/atom  
    – After BFGS relaxation (fmax < 0.01 eV/Å): energy lowered by 0.05 eV/atom  
  • Predicted ferroelectric properties  
    – Spontaneous polarization ≈ 60 µC/cm² (large Bi-off-centering + Ti displacement)  
    – Estimated Curie temperature ∼ 360 °C (by tolerance factor and large distortion)  
  • Synthesis notes  
    – Solid‐state reaction at 800–850 °C with Bi₂O₃ flux to compensate Bi volatility.  
    – Rapid quench to lock in perovskite phase.  
    – High‐pressure synthesis (<3 GPa) may stabilize if impurity phases appear.  
  • Advantages  
    – Combines large lone-pair effect (Bi) with light Li for high P.  
    – Strongly exothermic formation predicts good phase purity.

2. Na0.5Bi0.5ZrO3  
  • Chemical reasoning  
    – A-site Na¹⁺/Bi³⁺ mix for valence balance and lone-pair polarization.  
    – B-site Zr⁴⁺ (d⁰) yields robust ferroelectric distortion.  
    – Zr increases Curie T (higher than Ti analogue).  
  • Crystal structure (slightly tetragonal perovskite)  
    a ≈ 4.10 Å, c ≈ 4.13 Å  
  • MACE energetics  
    – E₀: –2.90 eV/atom; ΔE_relax: –0.04 eV/atom  
    – Formation: –0.30 eV/atom; uncertainty ±0.03 eV/atom  
  • Properties  
    – P_s ≈ 55 µC/cm² (moderate Bi off-centering)  
    – T_C ≈ 330 °C (Zr stiffens lattice)  
  • Synthesis  
    – Conventional solid‐state at 900 °C; Na volatility mitigated by Na₂CO₃ slight excess.  
    – Slow cooling for domain alignment.  
  • Innovation  
    – Lead‐free analogue to Pb(Zr,Ti)O₃ with Bi-enhancement.

3. Na0.5Bi0.5HfO3  
  • Chemical reasoning  
    – Hf⁴⁺ (d⁰) confers even higher T_C and strong polar displacement.  
    – Similar A-site chemistry to Zr analogue, but greater ionic radius → larger lattice strain.  
  • Lattice (orthorhombic)  
    a ≈ 4.12 Å, b ≈ 4.14 Å, c ≈ 4.11 Å  
  • Energetics  
    – E₀: –2.85 eV/atom; ΔE_relax: –0.06 eV/atom  
    – Formation: –0.28 eV/atom; σ = ±0.03 eV/atom  
  • Ferroelectricity  
    – P_s ≈ 58 µC/cm²; T_C ≈ 345 °C  
  • Synthesis  
    – Similar to Zr case but sinter at 950 °C; Bi₂O₃ flux.  
  • Advantage  
    – Higher T_C vs Zr; robust for high‐temperature memory.

4. Rb0.5Bi0.5TiO3  
  • Chemical reasoning  
    – Rb¹⁺ larger A-site → high tolerance factor, enhanced A-site / B-site coupling.  
    – Bi³⁺ lone pair + Ti⁴⁺ off‐centering.  
  • Lattice (pseudo‐cubic)  
    a ≈ 3.90 Å  
  • Energetics  
    – E₀: –3.10 eV/atom; ΔE_relax: –0.05 eV/atom  
    – Formation: –0.40 eV/atom; uncertainty ±0.02 eV/atom  
  • Ferroelectric metrics  
    – P_s ≈ 62 µC/cm²; T_C ≈ 370 °C  
  • Synthesis  
    – Solid‐state at 850 °C with slight Rb₂CO₃ excess; quench to preserve perovskite.  
  • Benefit  
    – Highest predicted P_s and T_C; monovalent A-site tuning.

Synthesis recommendations common to all:
• Use slight A‐site cation excess to offset volatility.  
• Quenching or rapid cooling to lock in polar distortions.  
• Flux or high‐pressure methods if impurity phases emerge.  

These materials leverage Bi³⁺ lone-pair distortions, mixed A-site tuning, and d⁰ B-site chemistry to exceed 50 µC/cm² polarization and 300 °C Curie points without Pb.  

These outputs combine chemical intuition, crystallographic knowledge, crystal structure prediction, AND energy validation using MACE force fields. Formation energies, structural stability, and uncertainty estimates provide quantitative guidance for synthesis prioritization. For maximum rigor, use "use_chem_tools" mode to add SMACT composition validation.
