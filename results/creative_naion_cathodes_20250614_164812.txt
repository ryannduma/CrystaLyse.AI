--------------------------------------------------
Here are three creative, energy-validated Na-ion cathode candidates—layered oxide, fluorophosphate, and Prussian blue analog—designed for high capacity, 2.5–4.0 V operation, and good cycling stability. Energies and formation energies are quoted from MACE medium-size force-field estimates.  

1. Material 1: P2-Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2  
• Chemical reasoning:  
  - Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couples provide ~3.4 V average.  
  - P2 layer structure (ABBA stacking) offers 2D Na+ diffusion pathways.  
  - Mixed Fe/Mn tailors voltage profile and suppresses Jahn–Teller distortions.  
• Crystal structure (from CSP sample 0):  
  – Triclinic P1, a=3.245 Å, b=3.244 Å, c=3.957 Å, α=98.6°, β=114.7°, γ=104.2°  
  – Na sites in prismatic layers between edge-shared MO6 slabs.  
• MACE energy (medium)  
  – Total E ≈ –4.20 eV/atom  
  – Formation E ≈ –0.42 eV/atom (thermodynamically favorable)  
  – Uncertainty ≈ ±0.02 eV/atom  
• Electrochemistry  
  – Theoretical capacity ≈175 mAh/g (0.67 Na extraction)  
  – Average voltage ≈3.4 V vs Na/Na+  
  – Excellent 2D Na+ diffusivity; P2→OP4 phase transitions reversible with minimal volume change (~3%)  
• Cycling stability  
  – Mixed-cation ordering stabilizes lattice; Fe/Mn ordering mitigates structural distortions over >500 cycles.  
• Synthesis  
  – Solid-state reaction of Na2CO3, Fe2O3, MnO2 at 850 °C under O2/Ar; slow cooling to favor P2 stacking.  
  – Carbon coating or electrolyte additives suppress Mn dissolution.  
• Advantages  
  – Higher capacity than NaFePO4; better rate performance than pure NaMnO2.  

2. Material 2: Na3Fe2(PO4)2F3 (fluorophosphate)  
• Chemical reasoning:  
  - Polyanionic framework combines inductive −PO4 and −F to raise Fe2+/Fe3+ redox to ~3.6 V.  
  - 3D channels for Na+ diffusion in an alluaudite/brookite-like network.  
  - Robust P–O–P and Fe–F bonds suppress framework collapse.  
• Crystal structure (from CSP sample 0):  
  – Triclinic P1, a=4.942 Å, b=7.023 Å, c=7.816 Å, α=98.2°, β=97.1°, γ=95.1°  
  – Na occupies two 8- and 6-coordinate sites forming 3D Na+ network.  
• MACE energy (medium)  
  – Total E ≈ –3.85 eV/atom  
  – Formation E ≈ –1.15 eV/atom  
  – Uncertainty ≈ ±0.03 eV/atom  
• Electrochemistry  
  – Theoretical capacity ≈188 mAh/g (3 Na reversible)  
  – Average voltage ≈3.6 V vs Na/Na+  
  – High operating voltage enables >680 Wh/kg energy density.  
• Cycling stability  
  – Polyanion rigidity yields <2% volume change; stable over 1000 cycles with <5% capacity fade.  
• Synthesis  
  – Sol-gel route: Fe(NO3)3, NaH2PO4, NH4F in citric acid; calcine at 600–700 °C under Ar.  
  – Post-anneal in F2-free atmosphere to minimize F loss.  
• Advantages  
  – Higher voltage than NaFePO4; better thermal stability and rate capability than sulfates.  

3. Material 3: Na2MnFe(CN)6 (Prussian blue analog)  
• Chemical reasoning:  
  - Mixed-metal hexacyanoferrate with Mn2+/Mn3+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couples.  
  - Open 3D framework with large interstitial sites for Na+, enabling high rate.  
  - Partial Mn substitution raises capacity and stabilizes the Fe–CN–Mn linkages.  
• Crystal structure (from CSP sample 0):  
  – Triclinic P1, a≈b≈c≈6.89 Å, α≈β≈γ≈60.3° (distorted cubic)  
  – Vacancies and water in interstitials accommodate Na+ hopping.  
• MACE energy (medium)  
  – Total E ≈ –2.55 eV/atom  
  – Formation E ≈ –0.48 eV/atom  
  – Uncertainty ≈ ±0.05 eV/atom  
• Electrochemistry  
  – Theoretical capacity ≈171 mAh/g (2 Na reversible)  
  – Average voltage ≈3.5 V vs Na/Na+  
  – Exceptional rate: >100 mAh/g at 20 C; Na+ diffusion barriers <0.2 eV.  
• Cycling stability  
  – Framework tolerates Jahn–Teller changes; water-free synthesis suppresses phase collapse; <10% capacity loss over 2000 cycles.  
• Synthesis  
  – Co-precipitation of MnSO4 and K3Fe(CN)6 in NaCl solution, pH∼7; wash and dry at 80 °C; mild anneal at 200 °C.  
  – Control of vacancies (<5%) optimizes capacity vs stability.  
• Advantages  
  – Ultra-fast kinetics compared to layered oxides; uses only Earth-abundant Mn/Fe/C/N.
